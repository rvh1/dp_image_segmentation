The algorithm is implemented efficiently, working with 'Image cubes' rather than the individual pixel values in an image. 

The results are compared with the traditional KMeans clustering algorithm. 

The GUI of the system can be invoked from the command line via 'python app.py'. More details about parameter initialisation 
options and background information are provided in the accompanying file 'Final Project Report.pdf'.
